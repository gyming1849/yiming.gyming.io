        I am a Masterâ€™s student in Computer Science at the University of Southern California. My research interests lie at the intersection of data management and real-world applications. To be more specific, I am fascinated by distributed database systems, database optimization and handling Non-conventional Data like Geospatial data.

        Beyond this, I have a decade-long dedication to programming and have achieved notable success, including earning a bronze medal at the National Olympiad in Informatics (NOI) and ranked 5th in ICPC Southern California Regional Contest, qualifying for the ICPC North American Championship 2025. 

        I am currently applying for PhD programs to further explore my research interests.
