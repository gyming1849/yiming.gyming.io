      text: |-
        I am a Masterâ€™s student in Computer Science at the University of Southern California with a passion for distributed database systems, database optimization, and geospatial data management. My research bridges theory and application, focusing on designing efficient systems to address real-world challenges in data access and scalability.

        Beyond academics, I have a decade-long dedication to programming and have achieved notable success in competitive programming, including earning a bronze medal at the National Olympiad in Informatics (NOI) and qualifying for the ICPC North American Championship in 2024. These experiences have shaped my problem-solving skills and commitment to innovation.

        I am currently applying for PhD programs to further explore this area.
